    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>First, they should click on the <a href="/coaches">Add a Coach</a> link at the bottom of the page.</p>
            <a href="/coaches"><img src="/images/add-a-coach.png" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background" /></a>
        </li>
        <li class="enter-email">
            <p>Then, they should enter your Coach ID in the form that looks like this:</p>
            <div class="coach-email">{{ coach_email|escape }}</div>
            <a href="/coaches"><img src="/images/enter-coach-email.png?{{App.version}}" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background"/></a>
            <p>
                Your Coach ID is <strong>{{ coach_email|escape }}</strong>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="click-register">
            <p>Finally, they need to click the <em>Register Coach</em> button. It looks like this:</p>
            <div class="coach-email">{{ coach_email|escape }}</div>
            <a href="/coaches"><img src="/images/click-register.png?{{App.version}}" class="vertical-shadow rounded-background"/></a>
        </li>
    </ol>
